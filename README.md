# Ciao

Ciao continuously provides the best set of free proxies available given user input like country or anonymity level.

Finding a working free proxy is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Despite several websites offer lists of free proxies, most of the proxies provided are either unreachable or can only transmit at few kbps. In some cases, they also perform malicious activities like malware injection, traffic interception, etc. Even when a working proxy is found, it might only last for a few minutes forcing the user to frequently re-iterate the quest for a "good" free proxy. 

Ciao is an android application that automates the discovery of free proxies. Given user input like desired country or anonymity level, Ciao continuously provides the best set of free proxies available. Ciao also dynamically splits user traffic among multiple proxies, so to rapidly find the best performing proxies and react to failures. 

Ciao identifies trusted and working free proxies using its own community. Ciao is instrumented to collect anonymous data about proxy performance and behavior (e.g., amount of data downloaded, download duration). This data is reported to our servers as an input for the proxy selection algorithm. To bootstrap this process, our servers discover free proxies by crawling proxy aggregator websites. Each proxy is then tested daily to verify reachability, performance, and behavior.
