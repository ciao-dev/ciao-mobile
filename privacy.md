# Privacy Policy

Ciao is an application developed for a research project aiming to sheed light on the free proxy ecosystem.
By installing and running the app, you will contribute to this research project.
To achieve our research goals Ciao is instrumented to collect anonymous data about proxy performance and behavior (see below for full details). This data is reported to our servers as an input for the proxy selection algorithm in a completely anonymous fashion. 

Data collection is disabled when Ciao is not enabled. We also do not collect browsing history, visited urls or domains, any personal identifiable information (PII) or long term constant identifiers like cookies, IP addresses, device informatiom, etc. 

App Permission
--------------

Ciao only requires full internet access in order to redirect network traffic to designated proxies. No other permissions are needed.

Data Collection
--------------

Anonymous data, collected by Ciao, includes:
* Flow-level information (i.e. amount of data transferred, application-layer protocol, and start/end times) 
* The application responsible for each flow.
* IP address and port number of proxies used. If the proxy is entered manually by the user rather than provided by our app, this information is not collected.
